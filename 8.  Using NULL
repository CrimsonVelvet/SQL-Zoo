Using NULL
Tasks:

1. List the teachers who have NULL for their department. 

Solution:
SELECT name
FROM teacher
WHERE dept IS NULL;

2. Note the INNER JOIN misses the teachers with no department and the departments with no teacher. 

Solution:
SELECT teacher.name, dept.name
FROM teacher INNER JOIN dept
ON (teacher.dept=dept.id);

3. Use a different JOIN so that all teachers are listed. 

Solution:
SELECT t.name, d.name
FROM teacher as t
LEFT JOIN dept as d
ON d.id=t.dept;

4. Use a different JOIN so that all departments are listed. 

Solution:
SELECT t.name, d.name
FROM teacher as t
RIGHT JOIN dept as d
ON d.id=t.dept;

5. Use COALESCE to print the mobile number. Use the number '07986 444 2266' if there is no number given. Show teacher name and mobile number or '07986 444 2266'

Solution:
SELECT name, COALESCE (mobile,'07986 444 2266')
FROM teacher;

6. Use the COALESCE function and a LEFT JOIN to print the teacher name and department name. Use the string 'None' where there is no department. 

Solution:
SELECT t.name, COALESCE(d.name,'None')
FROM teacher as t
LEFT JOIN dept as d
ON t.dept=d.id;

7. Use COUNT to show the number of teachers and the number of mobile phones. 

Solution:
SELECT COUNT(name), count(mobile)
FROM teacher;

8. Use COUNT and GROUP BY dept.name to show each department and the number of staff. Use a RIGHT JOIN to ensure that the Engineering department is listed. 

Solution:
SELECT d.name, count(t.name) 
FROM dept as d
LEFT JOIN teacher as t
ON d.ID = t.dept
GROUP BY d.name;

9. Use CASE to show the name of each teacher followed by 'Sci' if the teacher is in dept 1 or 2 and 'Art' otherwise. 

Solution:
SELECT name, CASE
             WHEN dept IN (1,2) THEN 'Sci'
             ELSE 'Art'
             END
FROM teacher;

10. Use CASE to show the name of each teacher followed by 'Sci' if the teacher is in dept 1 or 2, show 'Art' if the teacher's dept is 3 and 'None' otherwise. 

Solution:
SELECT name, CASE
             WHEN dept IN (1,2) THEN 'Sci'
             WHEN dept IN (3) THEN 'Art'             
             ELSE 'None'
             END
FROM teacher;
