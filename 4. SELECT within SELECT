Tasks:

1. List each country name where the population is larger than that of 'Russia'. 

Solution:
SELECT name FROM world
WHERE population >
(SELECT population FROM world
WHERE name='Russia');

2. Show the countries in Europe with a per capita GDP greater than 'United Kingdom'.

Solution:
SELECT name
FROM world
WHERE GDP/population > (SELECT GDP/population FROM world where name = 'United Kingdom') AND continent = 'Europe';

3. List the name and continent of countries in the continents containing either Argentina or Australia. Order by name of the country.

Solution:
SELECT name, continent
FROM world
WHERE  continent in (SELECT Distinct continent FROM world WHERE name in ('Argentina', 'Australia'))
ORDER BY name;

4. Which country has a population that is more than Canada but less than Poland? Show the name and the population.

Solution:
SELECT name, population
FROM world
WHERE population > (Select population from world where name = 'Canada') 
AND population <(Select population from world where name = 'Poland');

5. Germany (population 80 million) has the largest population of the countries in Europe. Austria (population 8.5 million) has 11% of the population of Germany.
Show the name and the population of each country in Europe. Show the population as a percentage of the population of Germany.

Solution:
SELECT name, CONCAT(ROUND(population/(Select population from world where name = 'Germany')*100),'%') as '%'
FROM world
WHERE continent = 'Europe';

6. Which countries have a GDP greater than every country in Europe? [Give the name only.] (Some countries may have NULL gdp values). 

Solution:
SELECT name
FROM world
WHERE GDP > (select max(GDP) from world where continent = 'Europe');

7. Find the largest country (by area) in each continent, show the continent, the name and the area.

Solution:
SELECT continent, name, area
FROM world as w1
WHERE area >=
(select max(area)
from world as w2
where w2.continent=w1.continent);

8. List each continent and the name of the country that comes first alphabetically.

Solution:
SELECT continent, name
FROM world as w1
WHERE name = (select name from world as w2 where w2.continent=w1.continent ORDER BY name limit 1);

9. Find the continents where all countries have a population <= 25000000. Then find the names of the countries associated with these continents. Show name, continent and population. 

Solution:
SELECT name, continent, population
FROM world as w1
WHERE continent = (select continent
  from world as w2
  where w2.continent = w1.continent
  group by continent
  having max(population)<= 25000000);
  
10. Some countries have populations more than three times that of all of their neighbours (in the same continent). Give the countries and continents.

Solution:
SELECT name, continent 
FROM world AS w1 
WHERE population > 3*(select population from world as w2 
where w1.continent=w2.continent 
order by population desc 
limit 1 offset 1)
